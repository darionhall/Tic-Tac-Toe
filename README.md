OBJECTIVE/USER STORIES:

* This game will allow the user to play a game of Tic Tac Toe on his/her computer.
* The user can play as many games as they please without having to refresh the page.
* Players will be able to click on a square and place a "X" or "O" as their game piece.
* If a player forms a row, column or diagonal with their pieces, they win the game. Essentially getting three of their pieces in order horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* Each player should try to win in the lowest possible number of moves.
* However, if the grid is full with no more cell/blocks to fill, the game ends in a draw. Players can choose to start a new game from scratch.
