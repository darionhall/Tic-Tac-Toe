 * Installation / Configuration

OBJECTIVE/USER STORIES:

* This game will allow the user to play a game of Tic Tac Toe on his/her computer.
* The user can play as many games as they please without having to refresh the page.
* Players will be able to click on a square and place a "X" or "O" as their game piece.
* If a player forms a row, column or diagonal with their pieces, they win the game. Essentially getting three of their pieces in order horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* Each player should try to win in the lowest possible number of moves.
* However, if the grid is full with no more cell/blocks to fill, the game ends in a draw. Players can choose to start a new game from scratch.


DESIGN / WIREFRAME:


Link to original wireframe can be found in the either of following links:

[https://gomockingbird.com/projects/q7r0d4r/4gXVnC]()

HTML - create a game board using sections and rows in the body element.

CSS - find a background from google that makes the game theme more apparent. Use CSS to form the game board. Lastly, use CSS to position the title, game board and reset button.


INSTALLATION / CONFIGURATION:


HTML - Create a game board by using sections with three rows, each row contain three cells. Forming a 3 x 3 grid for tic tac toe. Create a button class called "reset" for restarting an existent game or starting a new game. Lastly, link my stylesheet, javascript and jquery to the index.html in the head.

CSS - use box border to section off each piece/cell of the game board. Use float: left attribute to help cells align for a traditional tic tac toe board. Find a background on google images that represents one of my many interest, music.

JavaScript/jQuery - Starting off with a greeting function that prompts a window asking for the player(s) name and saying welcome to Tic Tac Toe. From there I use different functions to: detect when a button is clicked, when a cell is clicked to collect all the moves, determine if a list of moves matches a winning combo, and display the winner to the user.
